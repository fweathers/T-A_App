# T-A_App

**T&A** is an iOS app allowing for early learners to identify different modes of transportation and animals. The goal is to allow for the user  to distinguish the difference between each categoryâ€™s items through visuals, sounds, and names. 

#### **How it works:** 

* The user will choose between Transportation or Animals on the main screen.
* Once the category is chosen, an image and name label will appear. 
* If the image is touched/tapped on, sound is played. 
* If the user taps outside of the image, a new image and label will appear.

#### **Motivation:**

Working with adults with disabilities, I wanted to create a more age appropriate application for this community with ease of use and engagement of multiple senses.

#### **Roadmap:**

* Add illustrations
* Work on UI/UX
* Assign colour scheme
